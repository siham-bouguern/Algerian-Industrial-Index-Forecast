# Algerian-Industrial-Index-Forecast
This project is a research that introduces and assesses four analytical models - namely, Linear Regression, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, and SARIMA - in the context of predicting Algeria's General Industrial Index. In this study, these four models are applied to assess and predict Algeria's general industrial production for the forthcoming decade (2021â€“2030) by utilizing a 50-years dataset provided by The National Office of Statistics (NOS).
