This project is a research that introduces and assesses four analytical models - namely, Linear Regression, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, and SARIMA - in the context of predicting Algeria's General Industrial Index. In this study, these four models are applied to assess and predict Algeria's general industrial production for the forthcoming decade (2021â€“2030) by utilizing a 50-years dataset provided by The National Office of Statistics (NOS).


This file contains codes which builds a model that forecasts the Industrial Production Trends in Algeria, given yearly General Index from 1970 to 2020.

To achieve this, the following tasks are performed:
- Importing libraries & Dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Method 1: Forecasting using Linear Regression
- Method 2: Forecasting using Exponential Smoothing
- Method 3: Forecasting using ARIMA
- Method 4: Forecasting using SARIMA
