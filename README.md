This project is a research that introduces and assesses four analytical models - namely, Linear Regression, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, and SARIMA - in the context of predicting Algeria's General Industrial Index. In this study, these four models are applied to assess and predict Algeria's general industrial production for the forthcoming decade (2021–2030) by utilizing a 50-years dataset provided by The National Office of Statistics (NOS).


This file contains codes which builds a model that forecasts the Industrial Production Trends in Algeria, given yearly General Index from 1970 to 2020.

## Analysis Steps
To achieve this, the following tasks are performed:
- Importing libraries & Dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Method 1: Forecasting using Linear Regression
- Method 2: Forecasting using Exponential Smoothing
- Method 3: Forecasting using ARIMA
- Method 4: Forecasting using SARIMA
